SERENITY (ground + structures + structures/crypto) 
-------------------------
My personal basic library
-------------------------

Note: Serenity is a 160 characters-per-row library!

This library provides a support for software development making available to the programmer basic data structures like hash tables, 
dictionaries, dynamic array and strings (and others). To compile one of the tests you have to replace the number in the variable 
"NUMBER" of the Makefile in the folder "tests" with the number of test you want to compile (for example you can compile test12.c 
using NUMBER = 12).

Make it and run!
