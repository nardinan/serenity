-------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nardinan/serenity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nardinan/serenity)

Note: This project has been marked as deprecated.
Note: Serenity is a 160 characters-per-row library!

This library provides a support for software development making available to the programmer basic data structures like hash tables, 
dictionaries, dynamic array and strings (and others). Thanks to the Makefile, this library is installed in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include/serenity folders; compile it using:

$ make

$ make install

If you want to compile, for instance, the source tests/test11.c you have to use

$ make tests number=11

Enjoy!
