SERENITY (ground + structures + structures/crypto + structures/infn) 
-------------------------
My personal basic library
-------------------------

Note: Serenity is a 160 characters-per-row library!

This library provides a support for software development making available to the programmer basic data structures like hash tables, 
dictionaries, dynamic array and strings (and others). This library will be installed in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include/serenity
folders; compile it using:

$ make
$ make install

If you want to compile, for instance, the source tests/test11.c you have to use

$ make tests NUMBER=11

Good work!
